<h2>Probe-It! Help</h2>

<p>There are many Prolog tutorials and examples on the web using proof
traces to describe how Prolog works. However, you may not be able to
"play" with the proofs or get additional information about
proof-related information such as resolution by browsing the these
proofs.

With the help of few Inference Web tools you may be able to change
your way of using and publishing proofs on the web. The Prolog code used
distributed in this page was tested on <a
href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a>. If you know that it
works on other versions of Prolog or you have an alternative code for
other version of Prolog, please let us know. </p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://trust.utep.edu/ciminer/software/probeit/probeit.zip">Probe-It!</a> (you will
need a java virtual machine to run Probe-It!)</li>
<li>Save <a href="../../examples/prolog/pmlx.pl">pmlx.pl</a> in your Prolog home directory</li>

<li>Enter in Prolog by typing <b><code>pl</code></b> and load pmlx.pl by
typing <b><code>[pmlx].</code></b> (including the period at the end).</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you are ready to use the PML's interface to Prolog. pmlx.pl defines the following
three predicates: </p>

<ol>
<li><b>why_all\1</b> : Use <b>why_all</b>(<i>goal</i>) to bring up explanatory proofs for all possible
ways of satisfying <i>goal</i></li>

<li><b>why\1</b> : Use <b>why</b>(<i>goal</i>) to bring up an explanatory proof for the first
way of satisfying <i>goal</i>.</li>
<li><b>why\2</b> : Use <b>why</b>(<i>goal, n</i>) to bring up an explanatory proof for the first

<i>n</i> ways of satisfying <i>goal</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to test the working of the tool on a simple test case: </p>

<ol>
<li>Save <a href="./prolog/testcase.pl">testcase.pl</a> in your Prolog home directory</li>

<li>Enter in Prolog by typing <b><code>pl</code></b> in you operating system prompt.</li>
<li>Load pml.pl by typing <b><code>[pml].</code></b> (including the period at the end).</li>
<li>Load testcase.pl by typing <b><code>[testcase].</code></b> (including the period at the end).</li>
<li>Now you can try any of the following: 
<ul>

<li><b>why_all(p(X)).</b></li>
<li><b>why(factorial(3, 6)).</b></li>
<li><b>why(factorial(3, X)).</b></li>
<li><b>why_all(factorial(3, X)).</b></li>
<li><b>why(f(X)).</b></li>
<li><b>why_all(f(X)).</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>


<i>Note: the pmlx.pl code above is quite simple and there are many
things we can do improve its use of PML such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>To record provenance information when files are loaded in Prolog</li>
<li>To use provenance information when generating proofs</li>
<li>To generating AND and OR proof trees in PML on demand</li>
</ul>
