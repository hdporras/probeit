This experiment requires that you classify gravity contour maps as <i>quality</i> or <i>low quality</i> and provide an explanation for your decision. Quality maps are always based on accurate data and generated with a high resolution for the density distribution of the data being mapped. Thus, high quality maps represent a region of the earth accurately where as low quality maps always misrepresent a region by either hiding features that exist or introducing features or anomalies (through error) that don't really exist. When you begin classifying maps you will be presented with a window shown below and sets of features (described later). The rules of the experiment are as follows:
<ul>
<li>maps are presented to users in sets which may include either one or three maps; the figure below shows a single map set</li>

<li>for each map in a set there is a corresponding classification/explanation question box, which is highlighted in red in the figure below</li>

<li>each question box must be answered in order to advance to the next set of maps

<li>a set of maps is always associated with a specific region; the map in the figure below is associated with the region -100/-97 longitude and 35/38 latitude, which is highlighted in purple in the figure below

<li>the list of currently available <i>features</i> are shown in the top right corner of the experiment window as shown in the figure highlighted in orange. As you progress through the experiment different combinations of features will be enabled for you to use (described next).</li>
