<h1>Experiment about to begin!</h1>

<table width=800>
<tr><td>

You are about to begin the experiment. The following are some final notes about your tasks:
<ul>

<li>There are a total of 12 sets of maps/questions that will be asked.</li>
<br>

<li>Once you have completed a scenario you will not be able to go back and change previous answers.</li>
<br>

<li>REMEMBER: quality maps are always based on accurate data and generated with a high resolution for the density distribution of the data being mapped. Thus high quality maps represent a region of the earth accurately where as low quality maps always misrepresent a region by either hiding features that exists or introducing features (through error) that don't really exist.</li>
<br>

<li>When there are three maps in a set, there may be more than one that is of high quality or low quality. In fact, all three maps may be high quality or all three may be have imperfections.</li>
<br>

<li>Think of your task as a game, where you are a detective trying to weed out criminal (i.e., low quality maps) from suspects (i.e., a set of maps) in a line-up. At your disposal you have only a few pieces of evidence for each suspect including: the suspect itself (i.e., viewer feature), possibly information about where the suspect is from (i.e., sources feature) and maybe information about how much other people trust the suspect (i.e., trust map feature). Given the pieces of evidence available to you, can you weed out the criminals?</li>
<br>

<li><b>IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO CORRECTLY CLASSIFY OR EXPLAIN EVEN A SINGLE MAP</b>. The information we are providing you may not be enough for you to correctly classify the maps as high/low quality. Please don't get frustrated if you find great difficulty in classifying some maps. Simply take a guess and move on :)</li>
