<h3>Goals</h3>
The goal of our study is to determine what information scientists need in order to correctly assess the quality of maps. Quality maps are always based on accurate data and generated with a high resolution for the density distribution of the data being mapped. As virtual organizations such as the Geosciences Network (GEON) succeed in establishing collaborative environments where scientists can share data by a click of a button, it becomes important to know where the data comes from, how it has been processed, and who collected it. Collectively this information is known as <i>provenance information</i>.
<br><br>
This particular phase of the experiment is focused on assessing the effectiveness of <i>trust</i> and <i>source</i>, two kinds of provenance information, in helping scientists to assess the quality of contour maps, in this case contour maps of gravity data. In our context, trust is based on the <i>popularity</i> of a given source (i.e., person, organization, or agent) in some scientific domain, which may be an indication about the quality of data provided by that source. Source information is simply information about the sources used to derive a map, which includes the name of the sources (e.g., University of Texas at El Paso or US Geological Survey).
